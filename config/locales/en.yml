# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        My name is Memmo and I can memorize some notes for you.

        Here is the list of commands that I understand:

        /add [text] - Create a new note
        Example: /add http://example.com/blah-blah
        Also you can simply enter any text without a command, I will assume you want to add it as a note

        /describe [tags] [name] - Describe last created note
        Example: /describe #url #example Example website

        /last [number] - Show given number of recently added notes
        Example: /last 5

        /get [tags] - Get all notes with given tags
        Example: /get #url #example

        /tags - Show list of existing tags
        Example: /tags

        /language - Change language
        Example: /language

        Hope you enjoy using me. Please write to my creator Dmitrii at vizvamitra@gmail.com if you have any suggestions or (Oh no!) encountered a bug.
